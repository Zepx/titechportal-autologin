# Titech Portal Auto-login

If you happen to be a Titech student then you probably know how tedious
logging into the web portal can be. This Google Chrome extension aims to
simplify this process by automatically filling the "login matrix".

Install from Chrome Web Store: [Link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/titech-portal-auto-login/mglldflbijilmkimahfloeogpfldnpam)

## How to use

First, go to the Options page and set up your login matrix. After that, an
icon will be shown in the Omnibar at the matrix login page that, if you press
it, will automatically fill in the login inputs.

## FAQ

  <dt>Will this extension steal my login information?</dt>
  <dd>
    No. The login matrix is only saved to your personal Chrome storage.
    If sync is turned on for this extension then it will sync with your other
    Chrome devices, otherwise the matrix information will only reside in the
    local Chrome storage. Also, saving a new matrix will clear the previous saved
    one.
