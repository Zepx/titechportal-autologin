# Titech Portal Auto-login

If you happen to be a Titech student then you probably know how tedious
logging into the web portal can be. This Google Chrome extension aims to
simplify this process by automatically filling the "login matrix".

## How to use

First, go to the Options page and set up your login matrix. After that, an
icon will be shown at the matrix login page that, if you press it, will
automatically fill in the login inputs.
