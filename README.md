# Titech Portal Auto-login

If you happen to be a Titech student then you probably know how tedious
logging into the web portal can be. This Google Chrome extension aims to
simplify this process by automatically filling the "login matrix".

Install from Chrome Web Store: [Link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/titech-portal-auto-login/mglldflbijilmkimahfloeogpfldnpam)

## How to use

First, go to the Options page and set up your login matrix. After that, an
icon will be shown in the Omnibar at the matrix login page that, if you press
it, will automatically fill in the login inputs.

## FAQ

  <dt>What happens to my login information?</dt>
  <dd>
    The login matrix is only saved to one's personal Chrome storage. If sync is
    turned on for this extension then the information will sync with other
    connected Chrome devices, otherwise it will only reside in the local Chrome
    storage. Furthermore, saving a new matrix will clear the previous saved one.
